# D2-Hashinator
Maps hashes to image names for dumped PPSSPP textures of Tales of Destiny 2.
Requires: 
- inputTex folder (Input the original image you want to compare + rename it to the replaced texture name)
- dumpedTex folder (The dumped textures from D2, which I will not be providing)

Hard coded for D2 skit faces specifically (see cropcoords variable), mostly to eliminate noise. Could be modified to match hashes for other games.
