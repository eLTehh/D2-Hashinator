# D2-Hashinator
Maps hashes to image names for dumped PPSSPP textures of Tales of Destiny 2.
Requires: 
- inputTex folder (Input the original image you want to compare + rename it to the replaced texture name)
- dumpedTex folder (The dumped textures from D2, which I will not be providing)

Could be optimized some more with a binary search for image size (width, height), I feel. 

Didn't implement optimizations since my samples run in ~1s — which isn't too bad if I'm mapping hashes only *once* every version update.

Hard coded for D2 skit faces specifically (see cropcoords variable), mostly to eliminate noise. Could be modified to match hashes for other games.
